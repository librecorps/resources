This is a draft page.
While it can exist in the source repo, it will not be visible on the main site until `draft: true` is removed.


## Readings

* [Why public institutions should release more of their hardware designs as Open-Source Hardware](https://forum.openhardware.science/t/why-public-institutions-should-release-more-of-their-hardware-designs-as-open-source-hardware/2235): opinion article from the open hardware initiator at CERN, Javier Serrano, gives a good overview of the current situation
* Free Innovation by Eric von Hippel: https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/free-innovation
* [How participative is open source hardware? Insights from online repository mining](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/D1341B4E550B8F42032585694B6DB8D8/S205347011800015Xa.pdf/how_participative_is_open_source_hardware_insights_from_online_repository_mining.pdf)
    * interesting study of how people work together (or governance even if it's not designed)
    * (there is so, so little info on governance for open hw that I think it's *so* important for the discussion to start)
* [Emerging Business Models for Open Source Hardware](https://openhardware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/joh.4/): many ideas on open hardware business models (more specifically for science but it's good food for thought)
* [Measuring Openness in Open Source Hardware with the Open-o-Meter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827118312095?via%3Dihub)
* [Open HW refs in Zotero (may be a bit messy)](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2312397/open_hardware/library)
* [Collaborative list of open hw resources](https://github.com/Open-Hardware-Leaders/Resources): This is the nirvana of open information on Open Hardware :heart:
