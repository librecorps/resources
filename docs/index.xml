      <description>Avoiding Common ML Traps Assessing common mistakes that lead to unintended side effects.
The Framing Trap
Failure to model the entire system over which a social criterion, such as fairness, will be enforced.
For this trap, we will want to look at our outcome variables. Are these variables a proxy of the actual outcome you wish to achieve? What evidence of existing negative bias currently exists with regards to these variables?</description>

      <title>Contributors License Agreements</title>

      <description>What are CLAs used for?
So a Contributor License Agreement is often seen being used in open source projects to form a legal agreement between an individual or company and a project maintainer. This agreement usually includes a waiver of copyright as well as the right to patent their contribution.
CLAs became popular during the early days of open source and Free software. Prior to the growth of platforms such as Github and GitLab patches were often emailed to mailing lists and accepted by maintainers as such.</description>

      <description>This document is used as a reference when conducting interviews with the UNICEF Innovation Fund cohorts. The interviews help us collect background and context for each teamâ€™s experience and familiarity with open source and participating in open source communities. This template provides some structure and guidance on what questions to ask and understand about each team.
Current situation This section helps us understand where each team is at the moment.</description>
