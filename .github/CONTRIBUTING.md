### Content Structure

As we have used markdown for majority of notes, I think keeping our notes in markdown is a good idea for now.  We have six categories that we will be putting our resources into. You can find those categories below and the corrosponding resources:

```bash
├── [ 4.0K]  ai/
│   ├── [  206]  _index.en.md
│   ├── [ 3.3K]  milestone-roadmap.md
│   ├── [ 2.5K]  model-card.md
│   └── [ 2.2K]  traps.md
├── [ 4.0K]  community/
│   ├── [  214]  _index.en.md
│   └── [ 2.8K]  reading-list.md
├── [ 4.0K]  legal/
│   ├── [ 2.3K]  cla.en.md
│   └── [  169]  _index.en.md
├── [ 4.0K]  outreach/
│   └── [  201]  _index.en.md
├── [ 4.0K]  project-management/
│   ├── [  186]  _index.en.md
│   └── [ 3.4K]  preliminary-interview-template.en.md
└── [ 4.0K]  tooling/
    └── [  189]  _index.en.md
```

### Creating new resources

If you wish to create a new resource under a category. Simply create a new markdown file containing the info you wish to have in the resource. Make sure you prepend a header describing the resource as below:

```markdown
---
title: "Title of the Resource"
date: 2019-09-03T11:02:05+06:00 # this is the date of the post
type: "post"
---
Rest of the resource goes here
```
